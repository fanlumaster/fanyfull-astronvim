# About

## preface

Maybe some people would say, it is useless for coding to spend such a lot of time on configuring code editors.

Who cares?

Just for fun :)

## description

99.99% inspired by [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim).

Based on AstroNvim, I made my own customized config by my own preference. Some of these configs are not that elegant, cause that now I don't have so much time to apply so said best practice.

But I also believe that someone would get it easy to configure some parts of neovim or AstroNvim when watching my config, to some extend. For example, I found that many guys do not exactly know how to change cursor color of neovide, a gui front-end app for neovim, I also did not know before, but eventually I make it. I think that's it and would make some little sense. For another example, that's hop-nvim, and I make it more like easymotion in vim and vscode-vim.
